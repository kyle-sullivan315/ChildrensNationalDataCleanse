# ChildrensNationalDataCleanse
Data cleaning project as part of my internship at Children's National Hospital

The excel file I had to clean had over 1500 columns and 6000 rows.
The majority of my cleansing was removing entries that had no values, condensing similar data points into one variable (ie: X1.1, X1.2, X1.3 into X1), and separating entries into distinct worksheets. 
These files are just example scripts to demonstrate the logic used.
